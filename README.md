Reading the code
----------------

At the moment the code is pretty much raw and undocumented (I'll take care of it in the future), but still easy to read. 
You will find the most interesting part (server side game logic) inside [robotab_bullet.py](https://github.com/20tab/robotab/blob/master/robotab_bullet.py), the client side part (Three.js graphic and command handling) instead is inside [robotab_bullet.js](https://github.com/20tab/robotab/blob/master/static/js/robotab_bullet.js)
